# NotGiphyUI

NotGiphyUI is an Angular frontend for [NotGiphy](https://github.com/corystone/notgiphy). This is a project that lets you search Giphy for images, save your favorites, and add arbitrary tags to them. It is my first experience with the Angular framework.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. It is currently hardcoded to use notgiphy.guitarzan.us:9999 as the backend. That server is set up to allow CORS from localhost:4200.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
